## What is CI/CD Pipelines?

1. Trigger multi stage tasks to produce certain outcomes
2. Automation the Integration and Deployment process

^ Q: know CI pipelines
^ Q: use CI pipelines
^ We have to go thru a few simple terminology
^ Remember old practices
^ This is not the official description for it

## Why I choose Gitlab CI?

1. Free tier for private usage[^1]
2. No need any extra manual setup[^2]
3. Come with Gitlab repo
4. In case if needed more minutes[^3]

^ Q: Git repo

## Basic Configuration


```yaml
image: docker:git

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy
  - production

services:
    - docker:dind

variables:
  IMAGE_TAG: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
  LATEST_IMAGE: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest
  STAGING_IMAGE: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:staging
```

^ Start with declaring

---

## Creating reusable functions

``` yaml
.login_and_pull: &login_and_pull
  before_script:
    - docker login -u gitlab-ci-token -p $CI_BUILD_TOKEN registry.gitlab.com
    - echo Pulling Docker from latest image...
    - set +e && docker pull $LATEST_IMAGE > /dev/null && set -e

.push_to_server: &push_to_server
  script:
    - Your script to push to server
    - Request your ochestration tools to 
      - upgrade the services using latest image tag
    - Push your image tag to another registry

```

^ Some script for reusable

---

## Declaring build stage

```yaml
build_dev:
  stage: build
  except:
    - master
  <<: *login_and_pull
  script:
    - docker build --cache-from $LATEST_IMAGE -t $IMAGE_TAG  . > /dev/null
    - docker push $IMAGE_TAG > /dev/null

build_staging:
  stage: build
  only:
    - master
  <<: *login_and_pull
  script:
    - docker build --cache-from $LATEST_IMAGE -t $IMAGE_TAG  . > /dev/null
    - docker push $IMAGE_TAG > /dev/null
    - docker tag $IMAGE_TAG $STAGING_IMAGE
    - docker push $STAGING_IMAGE > /dev/null
```

^ Except and Only

---

## Deployment[^4]

``` yaml
deploy_staging:
  stage: deploy
  only:
    - master
  environment:
    name: staging # Affect by Gitlab environment variables
  <<: *push_to_server
```

---

## After client review

```yaml
deploy_production:
  stage: production
  image: cdrx/rancher-gitlab-deploy
  only:
    - master
  when: manual
  <<: *push_to_rancher
```

^ You can use another base image
^ You can trigger the deployment or test manually
^ Rancher is an orchestration tools, it is too broad to cover
^ I didn't create a test project for this talk

---

## What else I can do?

1. Run a services for each pull request[^5]
2. Run a comprehensive test with docker local database[^6]

## What's next?

1. Auto DevOps[^7]
2. Knative[^8]

^ What I might look into in future
^ requirements - base domain constraints
